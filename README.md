# Analysis of
Hello and welcome to Knowledge Check 3, where we explore "Salaries within the Data Sphere." We downloaded the data and transferred it to Python, where we cleaned it and converted the file into a CSV format.

Once the CSV file was structured, we analyzed the data in various ways based on the individual expertise within our group. We conducted a total of nine analyses, which we have linked in the repository. The different "pages" represent our individual analyses, which we have been working on over the past two weeks.

In the code, we have added comments to help visitors understand what we have done and to make it easier to edit the code if needed.
